## I. Introduction

### 1. Business question

- Customer churn prediction is a critical aspect of business management. It involves understanding and addressing customer attrition, which refers to the loss of clients or customers.
- For businesses in these sectors, measuring customer attrition is a vital business metric. This is because retaining an existing customer is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring a new one. As a result, these companies often have customer service branches dedicated to re-engaging customers who are considering leaving. This is because the long-term value of recovered customers far outweighs that of newly acquired ones.
- To address customer churn, predictive analytics comes into play. One ecommerce company has a project on predicting churned users in order to offer potential promotions.
- You will using these dataset to answer below questions:
- - 1. What are the patterns/behavior of churned users? What are your suggestions to the company to reduce churned users.
- - 2. Build the Machine Learning model for predicting churned users.
